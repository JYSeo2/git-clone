#values can not be changed. we should assign new value to variable.
selfish = '01234567'
        #  01234567

#selfish[0] = 100
#print(selfish) in this case, value 0123457 can not be changed but the below case can be possible like adding

selfish = selfish + '100'
print(selfish)

selfish = 100

print(selfish)
