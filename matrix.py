#matrix
#array VS list Array can be used in mutiple languages on the other hand, list is used in python
matrix = [
    [1, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 1]
] #we can displax x in screen
# the over array is main array, 1st array is subarray

print(matrix[0] [1]) #1st array and 2nd one in 1st array

matrix_2 = [
    [1, 5, 1],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 1]

print(matrix_2[0] [1])

#we can expand matrix. so we can print like this way, print(matrix[] [] [] [])
